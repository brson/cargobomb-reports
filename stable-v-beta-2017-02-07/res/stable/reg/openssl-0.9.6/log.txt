kablam! trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the

kablam! If you're in a situation where you think the directory *should* be found
kablam! automatically, please open a bug at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl

kablam! It looks like you're compiling on Linux and also targeting Linux. Currently this
kablam! requires the `pkg-config` utility to find OpenSSL but unfortunately `pkg-config`
kablam! could not be found. If you have OpenSSL installed you can likely fix this by
kablam! installing `pkg-config`.
