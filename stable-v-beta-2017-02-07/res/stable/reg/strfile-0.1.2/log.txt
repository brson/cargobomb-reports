kablam! warning: parsed version requirement `0.3.1.3` is no longer valid
kablam! 
kablam! Previous versions of Cargo accepted this malformed requirement,

kablam! of strfile 0.1.2, and the correct version requirement is `^0.3.13`.
kablam! 
kablam! This will soon become a hard error, so it's either recommended to
kablam! update to a fixed version or contact the upstream maintainer about
kablam! this warning.
